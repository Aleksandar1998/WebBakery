# WebBakery
The goal of the project was to create 5 module web application that provides CRUD on each of the modules and allows modules to echange data between each other.
For example: Module warehouse provides interface for user to add raw materials. Second module, eg. production, consumes the amount of raw ingredients in the warehouse and creates data that represents baked cakes ready to sell.
Also it provides admin panel which shows how many cakes were sold for certain period of time or money earned, over the Chart.js library.
